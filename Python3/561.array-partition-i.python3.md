Testcase Example:  '[1,4,3,2]'


Given an array of 2n integers, your task is to group these integers into n
pairs of integer, say (a1, b1), (a2, b2), ..., (an, bn) which makes sum of
min(ai, bi) for all i from 1 to n as large as possible.


Example 1:

Input: [1,4,3,2]

Output: 4
Explanation: n is 2, and the maximum sum of pairs is 4 = min(1, 2) + min(3,
4).



Note:

n is a positive integer, which is in the range of [1, 10000].
All the integers in the array will be in the range of [-10000, 10000].

```

## Solution(Python3)
### 思路一
发现问题的规律，解决方案是先升序排序，按顺序依次把两个组成一个pair，此时即可取出每个pair的最小值求和。
```python
class Solution:
    def arrayPairSum(self, nums):
        """
        :type nums: List[int]
        :rtype: int
        """
        if len(nums) == 0:
            return 0
        else:
            new_nums = sorted(nums)
            return sum(new_nums[::2])
```
